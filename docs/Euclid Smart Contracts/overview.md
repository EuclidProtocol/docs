# Overview

In the [Architecture Overview](../Architecture%20Overview/General%20Overview.md), we took a look at the different components that make up the Euclid Unified Liquidity layer. In this section, we will be looking at each of the Euclid smart contracts and their respective messages. 

Since the Factory smart contract is the only entry point for users/projects to interact with the Euclid layer, we will be providing a breakdown of the execute messages as well as the queries. For the rest of the contracts, no messages can be called directly on them so we are only interested in the available queries.

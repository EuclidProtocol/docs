# Introduction

Euclid is an open-source decentralized unified liquidity layer designed to allow any application to integrate into a unified source of truth. By creating a unified liquidity layer that connects blockchains, Euclid fosters a collaborative ecosytem where everyone benefits from increased liquidity, reduced slippage, and a seamless trading experience.

Furthermore, Euclid's modular architecture empowers dApps to access a vast pool of liquidity from any integrated chain, enabling them to easily interact with tokens across the entire ecosystem. 

# Mission

Euclid's mission is to unlock the true potential of decentralized finance by empowering developers, users, and token projects with a robust, permissionless, and efficient protocol for accessing and managing liquidity across the entire blockchain space.

# Transforming the DeFi Landscape

### The Problems before Euclid

Before Euclid, the DeFi landscape faced significant challenges due to fragmented liquidity. High slippage was a major issue; limited liquidity on individual DEXs and chains caused significant price fluctuations, particularly for larger trades, resulting in a poor user experience and unpredictable trading costs. Additionally, moving assets between different blockchains was complex and costly, requiring users to navigate bridges and deal with potential security risks and delays. New DeFi projects struggled to attract liquidity, often having to compete with established platforms for a limited pool of users and capital. All of this has created a frustrating and inefficient user experience.

## What Euclid Offers to the Space

Euclid's unified liquidity protocol directly addresses these challenges, creating a more efficient, interconnected, and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem.

### DEXs

Integrating with Euclid grants DEXs access to a significantly larger, unified liquidity pool. This leads to deeper order books, tighter spreads, and reduced slippage for their users, making the platform more attractive for trading. Additionally, DEXs can leverage Euclid's existing infrastructure and APIs, allowing them to focus on developing unique features and user experiences rather than building and maintaining complex liquidity management systems. By utilizing Euclid's unified liquidity layer, DEXs can attract users from various chains, expanding their reach and potential trading volume.

### Users

For users, Euclid offers a smoother trading experience. Unified liquidity results in less slippage and more predictable pricing, making trading more efficient and user-friendly. Users can also seamlessly trade assets across different blockchains without the need for bridging processes, simplifying cross-chain interactions.

### Layer 2 Projects

Projects benefit from increased visibility and higher trading volume. Integration with Euclid exposes tokens to a wider audience of traders and investors across multiple chains, enhancing their visibility within the DeFi ecosystem. Euclid's unified liquidity and interoperability open up a world of new possibilities for layer 2 projects where they can leverage Euclid's protocol to build innovative cross-chain applications and unlock previously inaccessible use cases, driving further adoption and utility for their tokens.

## How is Euclid Able to Offer all of the Above?

In the upcoming sections, we will be taking a look at the innovative architecture Euclid has created to be able to tackle all the existing problems in the Defi space.
